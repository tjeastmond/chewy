- [ ] Running `export-resume` before building throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `dist/cli.js` (should print a helpful message instead).
- [ ] `tests/json-schema-to-zod.test.ts` referenced a missing `src/validators/jobTrackerFromJsonSchema.js` module (stale test / missing source file).
- [ ] `pnpm build` fails because `src/cli.ts` contains JSX/Ink components but is compiled as plain TS (should be `.tsx` + tsconfig JSX + React peer dep installed).
- [x] CLI does not create missing `--out-dir` directories and errors may not result in a non-zero exit code (hard to use in scripts).
- [ ] `bin/export-resume` should call `runCli()` from `dist/cli.js`; relying on auto-run inside the module breaks when imported from the bin wrapper.
- [ ] `--format txt` still attempts to render HTML (and may error if the default template path can’t be found); HTML rendering should be conditional, and default template lookup should work when bundled.
- [ ] `tests/build.test.ts` can be flaky because multiple tests invoke `pnpm build` in parallel.
